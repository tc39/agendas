## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [September 3rd, 10:00 JST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20220903T01&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ”added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

_Schedule constraints should be supplied here **48 hours** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule._

* JSC cannot be present on Tuesday, September 13 on 10–11 am GMT+9 (6–7 pm PDT).

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->

- Axel Rauschmayer: If possible, I’d like to start as early as possible (any of the 4 days is OK). Later times would be challenging, due to the time difference with Europe.
- Nicolò Ribaudo will not be available on Friday, and wants to be present for "Refactor of import-related Host Hooks" and "Record & Tuple".
- Robin Ricard will only be available during the second slots every day: 13:00 to 15:00 JST
- Patrick Soquet will only be available during the second slots every day: 13:00 to 15:00 JST. Patrick wants to be present for "Refactor of import-related Host Hooks" and "Record & Tuple".
- Mathieu Hofman will only be available during the first slot of every day: 10:00 to 12:00 JST, and would like to be present for "Explicit Resource Management"
- Philip Chimento unavailable during Day 3 and the first slot of Day 2. Second slot of Day 2 is OK but not preferred. Must be present for "Temporal update" and would prefer to be present for "Intl.DurationFormat" and both iterator helpers items.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->
