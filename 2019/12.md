## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [**23 November 2019 10:00 PST**](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20191123T18&msg=73rd%20Meeting%20of%20TC39%3A%20agenda%20deadline%20for%20proposal%20advancement)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 0 or 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

1. Other business
    1. Thank host
1. Adjournment

### Schedule constraints

   * Mark S. Miller (@erights) would prefer all three of his (OOM, Pipelining, Virtualizability) on Thursday. Wednesday would be fine. I could do any on Tuesday if needed, but it'll be less polished.
   * Please give Shu-yu Guo a 1 hour warning before the RegExp match indices feedback agenda item is up to coordinate with Joshua Litt
   * Ben Coe would prefer to give the update on UUID on Wednesday (as he will be able to attend in person).
   * Dan Ehrenberg will only be available after lunch on Wednesday and Thursday (unless this is impossible to satisfy with his presentations + SLTG)
   * Sven will be present on Thursday afternoon and not Wednesday; it would be ideal if module attributes could be on Thursday so he could co-present.
