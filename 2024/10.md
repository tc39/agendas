Background:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock's [paper on standards committee participation for new attendees](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
- TC39's documentation on [How to participate in meetings](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md)

## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [September 28th, 10:00 JST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=540&iso=20240928T10&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ‚Äúadded‚Äù for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 2.7, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee‚Äôs judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->

- Daniel Minor can only present `Map.emplace` before 1pm JST, and would like to attend "JSSugar/JS0" with the same time constraint.

- Dominic Farolino can only present the `Observable` API between 10am JST and
  1pm JST, either Tuesday the 8th, or Wednesday the 9th.

- Nicol√≤ Ribaudo prefers to present in the afternoons, and prefers the JSSugar discussion to happen on the last day.

- Guy Bedford is available to present before 2pm JST any day, with a preference for 1pm - 2pm JST

- Peter Hoddie would like to attend "Immutable ArrayBuffers", "JSSugar/JS0", and "DataView get/set Uint8Clamped methods" but is only available before 1pm JST (all days).

- Kevin Gibbons is only available before 3pm JST and would weakly like to attend the Shared Structs item, though if it proves impossible to accomodate this in addition to everyone else's constraints it's fine.

- Shu-yu Guo would like to present Shared Structs before JSSugar/JS0. No absolute time constraints, just relative. The two items don't need to be consecutive or anything, just relatively ordered.

- Mathieu Hofman would like to be present for Shared Structs and the Eval Twin discussion, but is not available Wed 9.

- The Temporal champions would prefer to schedule the 10-minute Temporal update early in the Tokyo day, but we're flexible about which day and what time.

- Ryan Hunt is only available before 1pm JST and would like to attend the Shared Structs item. It's okay if that is not possible.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->
