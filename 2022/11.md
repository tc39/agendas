## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [November 19th, 10:00 CEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20221119T08&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ”added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

_Schedule constraints should be supplied here **48 hours** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule._

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->

 - Leo Balter is attending from California, preference for the ShadowRealm topic being discussed at the the last hour of the meeting, any of the days.
- The "module declarations" topic should come right after "module expressions" (Nicolò Ribaudo)
- Shu-yu Guo might not be able to attend Thursday, December 1; lowest priority items for @syg are Intl-related, so preference for Intl items on that day.
 - Alex Vincent is attending from California and would (weakly) prefer to present Mass Proxy Revocation either at the beginning or the end of any day's session.
- Philip Chimento is available either the first or last hour of the meeting on any day, to present Temporal. If this is not possible, we can arrange an alternate presenter if given some advance notice. Would prefer to be able to attend "Is ECMA-402 allowed to extend ECMA-262 prototypes?" as well, but that's not as high of a priority.
- Frank Yung-Fong Tang is attending from California, cannot attend afternoon on Thursday, December 1 and prefer to present all his topics in one batch, either in the morning of Wednesday, November 30 or the morning of Thursday, December 1.
- Santiago Díaz cannot attend Thursday, December 1 and needs to be present for "Prototype pollution mitigation / Symbol.proto"
- Jordan Harband would prefer to only attend for the first two hours of each day, and would like to be present for whatever is possible out of Array.prototype.group, Well-Formed Unicode Strings, set methods, iterator helpers, dedent, await ops, module declarations, Symbol.proto.
- Guy Bedford is attending from British Columbia for modules-related agenda items with a preference for the last 2-3 hours of each day.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->
