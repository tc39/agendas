Background:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock's [paper on standards committee participation for new attendees](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
- TC39's documentation on [How to participate in meetings](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md)

## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [July 19th, 10:00 PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=137&iso=20240719T10&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ‚Äúadded‚Äù for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 2.7, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee‚Äôs judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->

- *concurrency control* should be discussed prior to *unordered async iterator helpers* because the latter has a dependency on the former
- Ron Buckton will not be able to attend after noon (PST) on July 30th nor the entirety of July 31st, but would like to be present for `Atomics.pause`, "concurrency control", "Async Context", and "Scrub of Stage 2 proposals", and "pretend primitives aren't iterable", in order of precedence.
- Andreu Botella would prefer not to present Async Context after 1 PM (PST) on July 31st or August 1st. They have no constraints on July 29 or 30th.
- Frank Yung-Fong Tang is only available to present 10:00 to 15:00 PDT (America/Los\_Angeles) on 30 July 2024.
- Michael Ficarra cannot present during the first hour of the meeting on Wednesday.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->

- Philip Chimento is not available Monday 29 July 11:45-14:00. (This doesn't affect anything currently planned.)
- Peter Klecha cannot present on July 31st.
