## Logistics

* **Where to park**: Parking is under Lincoln Square. Take a ticket and bring it with you to validate with Visitor Reception when you check in.
* **How to access the building**: Take the elevators from the parking garage to the Lincoln Square lobby, then take another elevator to the 15th floor. Check in on the 15th floor with Microsoft reception. You can wait for an escort, but the meeting venue can be accessed without an escort.
* **Additional Meeting Space**: I have reserved a meeting room for breakouts or private meetings. Please talk to @bterlson to reserve this room.
