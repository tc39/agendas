## Logistics

### Where to park

Parking is expensive in the area. The common rate is $36/day.

Street parking has a 2 hours limit.

The [Chinatown Parking](https://goo.gl/maps/ojxnnqc2T4t) is the closest place open until late. 

### How to access the building

There is a common entrance in front of the build and another entrance by the Utica Street. Signs will be at the doors.

### Technical presentation requirements (adapters, google hangouts/other accounts required, etc.)

We are planning to use Google Hangouts. We should have video adapters for at least HDMI, VGA and thunderbolt ports.

### From the airport

The airport has an easy access to the Blue line with free shuttles, otherwise, car pool services (Lyft, etc) are recommended while regular cabs won't provide the best experience.

### Any other logistics required to participate in the meeting

The weekly pass for the T (including the airport station) is around $21.

The venue is close to the South Station on the red line of the T (MBTA). The red line has easy connection to the orange and green lines.
