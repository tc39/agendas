1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.

    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.

    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.

### Schedule constraints

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->
 - Ergonomic Brand Checks would prefer to go after FF 90 is released, which is slated for between day 1 and 2 of plenary this week - ie, not on day 1, but probably day 2 is fine.
 - Dan Clark is not available the first day (July 13), so any other day is preferred for Import Assertions.
 - Caridy, Leo preference to present at the second half (11PM East Time) of **the first day**, but also the second half of other days.
 - Philip Chimento not available on the final day, nor in the first hour or so of each day
 - Jamie Kyle is not available on the first day (July 13), so any other day is preferred for "Accessible Object hasOwnProperty".
