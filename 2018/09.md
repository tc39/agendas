### Schedule constraints

- Domenic will only be there on Thursday and would like to attend the "IDL for JavaScript" presentation. Ideally also `Promise.allSettled` but that is less important.
- Leo Balter and Isaac Durazo (Bocoup) can't attend the meeting on Thursday, we have a presentation to give and we would like it to be on Tuesday or Wednesday
- Isaac Durazo (Bocoup) is attending the meeting from a different time zone, but anytime after 11am works for him.
- Yulia Startsev will be attending remotely from Berlin. She will be available from 10am everyday until around 2pm or 3 pm.
