## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [October 15th, 2021 10:00 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20211015T09&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ”added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->
 - Jordan Harband will be available after 1PM BST (5AM PT), for his own items, but also for bind-this, array grouping, string.cooked, function helpers, extending null, partial application, evaluator attributes, and subclassing (in that priority order) - also, if the change array by copy item is not during these times, he would like to be a reviewer.
- Philip Chimento and Justin Grant would prefer Temporal to be scheduled in the last hour of the 26th, 27th, or 28th. If that's not possible, we can probably make the first hour work or possibly find an alternate presenter.
- Surma is only available on October 25th
- Nicolò Ribaudo would prefer Records&Tuples to be scheduled after 11:00 BST on Monday 25th, after 13:00 BST on Wednesday 27th, or before 12:00 BST on Thursday 28th.
- Ashley Claymore (change-array-by-copy) is unavaliable after 13:00 BST on Wednesday 27th
- Frank Yung-Fong Tang (Intl Locale info update) is unavaliable Monday 25th and prefer Intl Locale info update to be schedule as first slot in either 26th, 27th, or 28th.
