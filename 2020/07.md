  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

    1. Thank host
1. Adjournment

### Schedule constraints

- Mathias is only available on July 21st from 10:00 to 11:00 PT (UTC -7) — could we schedule the `Promise.any` & `AggregateError` item then?
- Philip Chimento (Temporal) only available Monday and Tuesday.
- Felienne Hermans (Cognitive Dimensions of Notation) only available Monday. Preferably earlier.
- Documenting Invariants talk should happen before discussion of Specific Invariant Topics.
- Ron Buckton will only be available on July 20th, will only have very limited availability July 21st-22nd, and will not be available July 23rd. If necessary, Daniel Rosenwasser will present in my place.
- Dave Poole (Examining Structural Racism) unavailable on Tues July 21; Requesting to present on Wednesday (July 22) or Thursday (July 23).
- Records and Tuples should be scheduled adjacently to Symbols as WeakMap keys.
- Sven Sauleau (Import Conditions) not available Monday.

### Presentations which can be deferred

The schedule is overfull and we won't be able to get to everything. In this section, TC39 delegates can volunteer to defer their own presentation to a future meeting.

- Daniel Ehrenberg: Operator overloading, and if necessary, extensible numeric literals.
