## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [Sept 12th 10:00 CDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20250912T10&p0=178&font=cursive)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ‚Äúadded‚Äù for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 2.7, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee‚Äôs judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->
- MF is only able to attend this meeting for the first 4 hours of Monday, the 22nd (I know, I'm sorry). If iterator chunking cannot be presented in that limited time range, KG will act as backup presenter.
- MAH would like to present promise related topics in the following order: "change PromiseResolve species check", "Native Promise Adoption", and "Native Promise Predicate". Collocated might make sense but not necessary.
- KKL would like to present "Update on proposal-module-global‚Äù in an afternoon session. If necessary and with forewarning, KKL can present at 11am Chicago at the earliest any day except Monday.
- Philip Chimento: I would prefer not to present on Monday 22nd, but I can do it if really needed.
- SFC would like to be present for "Increase limits on Intl MV", "Amount for Stage 2", "Temporal update", and Ben Allen's two ECMA-402 PRs. SFC is *not* available from 13:00-15:00 on Monday, 10:00-13:30 on Tuesday, 12:30-13:30 on Wednesday, and 10:00-12:00 on Thursday (all times in CDT). He is available 10:00-12:30 on Wednesday but prefers to not be the presenter (of "Increase limits on Intl MV") at that time.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->
- SFC would like to attend "Convention: strings-as-enums are kebab-case". Schedule constraints are the same as those listed above under "Normal Constraints".
