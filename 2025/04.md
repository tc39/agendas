Background:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock's [paper on standards committee participation for new attendees](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
- TC39's documentation on [How to participate in meetings](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md)

## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [April 4th, 10:00 EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=179&iso=20250404T10&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as “added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 2.7, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->
- Jordan Harband will not be present for the first 2 hours of each day, and the last hour of days 1, 3, and 4, and would like to be present for the following items: Consensus, Object.propertyCount, Non-extensibile Applies to Private, Compare Strings By Codepoint, Composite Keys, Upsert, Enums, Immutable ArrayBuffer, export defer
- Nicolò Ribaudo will not be available on the second day. Other than for my presentations, I'd like to be present (in order of priority, Decimal is the only one I strongly care about) for Decimal, AsyncContext (both presentations) Composite keys, enums.
- Luca Casonato will not be available on the second day. I need to be present for Disposable AsyncContext.Variable, and would like to be present for composite keys.
- Steve Hicks will not be available after 11am on day 4, and I'd like to participate in the two AsyncContext discussions.
- Ron Buckton will not be available after 2:30pm on days 1 and 2 and needs to be present for "Explicit Resource Management implementer feedback" and "Disposable AsyncContext" in addition to his own topic.
- Philip Chimento: Feel free to deprioritize "Guidelines for Locale-Sensitive Testing in Test262" if time is short.
- Shane F Carr would like to attend the following topics: Intl Era Month Code (required), Decimal (required), Compare Strings by Codepoint (required), Guidelines for Locale-Sensitive Testing in Test262 (required), Composite Keys (optional). He is *not* available at the following times (all in EDT): Monday after 12pm (other meetings); Tuesday (traveling); Thursday after 11:30am (commute and other meetings).
- The AsyncContext stage 2 presentation should be before the Disposable AsyncContext one, not necessarily back-to-back.
- 'Withdrawing Records & Tuples' should be after 'Composite Keys for Stage 1'
- ❄️  Dominic Farolino can present Observables on any of the following: Tuesday, 10:00–13:00 EDT; Wednesday, 10:00–12:00 EDT; Thursday, 10:00–13:00 EDT.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->

- Philip Chimento: I will not be available for the last 30 minutes of Wednesday 16 April.
- Aki Rose Braun: I will be unavailable the last hour of Monday and the second half of Wednesday. I have a strong preference to be present for the Consensus discussion.
