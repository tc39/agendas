## Registration

[Doodle](https://ecma-international.doodle.com/poll/iksxv4v23c7s35hz) (TC39 members only)

All visitors must be pre-registered in the Doodle to have a badge available upon arriving.

## Hotels

Since the building is directly above the train station, seek hotels directly above the 4/5 train (e.g. Grand Hyatt at Grand Central 42nd St station, or W Union Square at 14th St station), or above the N/R/W train (e.g., Central Park hotels near 5th Ave station). Smaller hotels are available a few blocks away, but pay attention to reviews from business travelers if possible. TC39 members in New York or that have attended previous New York meetings can give recommendations.

## Holiday

Monday 28th May 2018 is a US holiday; travel and hotel volume might be higher than usual the week of the meeting, so please plan accordingly.
