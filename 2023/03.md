## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [March 11th, 10:00 PST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20230311T18&msg=TC39%20S%20%20%20%20ubmission%20deadline)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ”added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

_Schedule constraints should be supplied here **48 hours** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule._

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->

- Guy Bedford will be unavailable for the morning session on Thursday the 23rd of March due to travelling back from Seattle.
- Chris Hewell Garrett will only be available from 11:30-17:00 PDT March 21st, and will be joining remote
- Chengzhong Wu is attending from Hangzhou, preference for the Async Contexts topic being discussed at the first two hours of the meeting, any of the days.
- Yulia Startsev is only available for 1 hour in the mornings. Prefer to present topics at the end of committee (happy to also fall off the agenda if proposals need more time).
- The "Import reflection update" topic should be scheduled before the "Import assertions/attributes for Stage 3" topic. Ideally these are scheduled directly after each other.
- Asumu Takikawa will be unavailable on March 23rd due to conflicting meetings and would prefer that the type annotations update be scheduled on either the 21st or 22nd.

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than 48 hours before the meeting should go here -->
