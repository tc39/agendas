1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.

    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
