## Logistics

### Where to park/how to access the building

Park in guest parking at [building 20](https://goo.gl/maps/atfiWWvkbAA2). Check in with reception/security and they will ping someone to come and get you.

[Building 20](https://goo.gl/maps/atfiWWvkbAA2) is the newer building that runs along Bayfront Expressway (AKA Highway 84) right up to the intersection where it intersects with Willow Rd. Feel free to reach out to Jeff if you get lost or have trouble finding your way in.

### Any other logistics required to participate in the meeting

Closer to the meeting there will be a link to video-conference in for non-local attendees.
If you intend to call in to the meeting, please ensure you coordinate a direct contect *at* the meeting in case there are issues with the VC system, etc.

### Hotels

**Sheraton Palo Alto Hotel
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto, CA 94301**
Fairly close and a nice hotel. Takes about 20mins (with traffic) to drive to Facebook.
Walking distance from the Palo Alto Caltrain station and University Ave, which has plenty of restaurants and coffee shops.

**Best Western Plus Riviera
15 El Camino Real
Menlo Park, CA 94025**
A 5-10min drive down the street from the Sheraton but a little more economical.
