  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 0 or 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

- Mathias is presenting several topics, but is calling in from CEST and will only be present on Wednesday. Ideal times are at 10 AM PDT sharp, or generally as early in the day as possible. Should preferably be around for any RegExp-related topics as well. (Suggested order for my agenda items for optimal time efficiency: `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any`, `String.prototype.replaceAll`, `Array.prototype.sort`.)
- Mike Sherov (OpenJS Foundation) is attending remotely for the Symbol.reverse part.
- Frank Tang is attending remotely for Intl.DisplayNames and can only present on Tuesday July 23.
- Domenic Denicola is attending day 2 and 3 for his topics, and would also like to be present for Built-in Modules.
- Till Schneidereit can't attend Thursday morning, and needs to attend the Built-in Modules discussion.
- Michael Fig can't attend Wednesday after 3pm. Should attend "SES Update", "SESify", "Infix Bang".
