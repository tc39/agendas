  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 0 or 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

1. Other business
    1. Thank host
1. Adjournment

### Schedule constraints
 - Jordan must be present for Standard Library, but will be calling in from PT. Ideal times are at 10AM CEST sharp, or after 3PM CEST. It would also be nice to be present for TLA and Optional Chaining, if possible.
 - Felienne will only be available on Thursday, with a preference to present in the morning. Yulia will present her topic shortly after.
 - Sathya will be arriving afternoon (~1pm local time) on Tuesday, and thus will not be able to present his proposals until then.
 - Leo is attending the meeting remotely from GMT -4 (EDT). Preference to see TC39-TG2 (Intl ECMA-402) related items in the afternoons. Valerie should give the status updates at her time convenience, thou.
 - Frank Y. Tang is attending the meeting remotely from US West Coast (PST). Prefer to present ECMA-402 PRs and Intl.DisplayNames in the local morning time (10:00 - noon) June 5 or 6.
 - Daniel Rosenwassser will arrive in the afternoon on June 4th. Optional chaining and nullish coalescing should be discussed when he is present.
 - Domenic and Anne have to leave at 3pm on Thursday June 6th, but should be present for "Status update on non-JS module types (e.g., JSON, CSS, WebIDL)", which is currently the last item.
 - Till has limited availability in the afternoons, but should be present for Standard Library and WeakRefs and ideally "How should we specify Jobs precisely?"
 - Myles would prefer TLA to take place on Thursday
