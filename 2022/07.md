## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [July 9th, 10:00 PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20220709T17&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)
  - <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ”added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4 must be added (and noted as such) *along with the necessary materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to supporting materials prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline. If these materials change substantially after the deadline, the proposal may be disqualified from advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

_Schedule constraints should be supplied here **48 hours** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule._

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

- Shu-yu Guo cannot attend on July 20 and would like to be present for Change-Array-by-copy, Import Reflection, Compartments, and R&T updates.
- Nicolò Ribaudo will only attend on the 19th and 20th, and would like to be present for (in order from the most important to the less important) Compartments, R&T updates, Import Reflection, Change-Array-by-copy.
- J. S. Choi cannot attend all day on July 19, as well as July 20 before 11 am PDT. They can attend on July 20 after 11 am PDT, as well as all day on July 21.
- Allen Wirfs-Brock can lead the PDF Specs discussion anytime on the 20th, after 11AM the 19th, or after noon the 21st.
- Philip Chimento (presenting Temporal) only available after 13:00 on the 20th and 21st. In addition to Temporal, I would prefer to be present for the test262 status update and the PDF discussion.
- The stenographer will work from 10 AM to noon on July 20th (unless other constraints come up, in which case Daniel Ehrenberg can work with the stenographer to try to reschedule). Ideally, that day would start with a brief stenography presentation, followed by two hours of topics which are happy to have stenographer support.
- Jack Works: I want to be present for (in order from the most important to the less important) `Pattern Matching`, `Compartments`, `Import Reflection`, `ShadowRealm`. I'm available on any day, but it is midnight for me. I prefer those topics are **continuously presented** (no other topics in the middle). I want to request that those topics **should not be presented earlier than the scheduled time**, otherwise I may miss it.
- Chengzhong Wu will only be available on first 2 hours and would like to be present for ShadowRealm.
