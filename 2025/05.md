Background:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock's [paper on standards committee participation for new attendees](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
- TC39's documentation on [How to participate in meetings](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md)

## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [May 16th 10:00 CEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20250516T10&p0=681&csz=1&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as “added” for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 2.7, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee’s judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->
- Samina would prefer the "ECMA Framework" topic to be discussed on Day 2 to give people time to mull it over and bring any questions or doubts the following day.
- J. S. Choi is unavailable until 15:00 (GMT+2) on all days and would strongly prefer 05-28 or 05-29 over 05-30.
- Peter Hoddie is available for the last two hours of each day and would like to be present for the Immutable ArrayBuffer topic and all entropy-related topics.
- Ron Buckton is only available the last two hours of each day and would like to be present for Assertions.
- Jesse Alama would prefer that the decimal update be presented after Eemeli Aro's "keep trailing zeroes", even though the former is at stage 1 and the latter is at stage 0.
- Jordan Harband will only be at the last 2 hours of each day, and would like to be present for: Error.isError, SeededPRNG, Assertions, Math.clamp, Iterator chunking, deadline change, Iterator sequencing
- Tab Atkins-Bittner is not available the last hour of each day (16:00 to 17:00), as that's "make breakfast/lunch for the wife" time, so don't schedule their topics (SeededPRNG, More Random Functions) then.
- Richard Gibson strongly prefers the last 3 hours of each day, and would like to be present for: Intl.Locale.prototype.variants, Temporal, Immutable ArrayBuffer, Iterator Sequencing, Iterator Chunking

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->
